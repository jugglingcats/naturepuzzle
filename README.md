My nephew and I were playing with one of those 3x3 block puzzles where you have to line up fish heads and tails so that they form a consistent grid. It was really a bit boring so we decided to get the computer to solve it, to see how many combinations there were and how fast the program would run. From memory there were around 200,000 possibilities, 4 solutions and the computer found all solutions in around 40ms ;-)
